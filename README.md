LLD for Car Comparison Application
This LLD outlines the design of the Car Comparison application based on the provided Java code.
1. Packages:
   org.example.api: Contains REST controllers for handling API requests.
   org.example.model: Contains data models for Car, FieldToValueMap, etc.
   org.example.service.comparison: Contains services for car comparison logic.
2. Classes:
   2.1. CarComparisonApi (REST Controller):
   Responsibilities:
   Handles API requests related to car comparison.
   Exposes endpoints for:
   Retrieving similar cars (/api/v1/cars/{carName}/similar).
   Comparing cars (/api/v1/cars/{carName}/compare).
   Generating comparison table (/api/v1/cars/{carName}/comparison-table).
   Generating difference table (/api/v1/cars/{carName}/difference-table).
   Methods:
   getSimilarCars(String carName): Calls CarComparisonService to retrieve similar cars based on the provided car name.
   compareCars(String carName, List<String> comparisonCars): Calls CarComparisonService to compare the provided car with the list of comparison cars.
   getComparisonTable(String carName, List<String> comparisonCars): Calls CarComparisonService to generate a comparison table for the provided cars.
   getDifferenceTable(String carName, List<String> comparisonCars): Calls CarComparisonService to generate a difference table for the provided cars.
   2.2. CarComparisonService (Service):
   Responsibilities:
   Implements the core logic for car comparison.
   Provides methods for:
   Retrieving similar cars.
   Comparing cars.
   Generating comparison table.
   Generating difference table.
   Methods:
   getSimilarCars(String carName): Retrieves a list of cars similar to the provided car name.
   compareCars(String carName, List<String> comparisonCars): Compares the provided car with the list of comparison cars and returns a list of cars.
   getCarComparisonTable(String carName, List<String> comparisonCars): Generates a comparison table for the provided cars, showing their attributes and values.
   getCarDifferenceTable(String carName, List<String> comparisonCars): Generates a difference table for the provided cars, highlighting the differences in their attributes.
   2.3. Car (Model):
   Responsibilities:
   Represents a car object.
   Holds attributes like make, model, year, horsepower, fuel efficiency, etc.
   2.4. FieldToValueMap (Model):
   Responsibilities:
   Represents a field and its corresponding value for a car.
   Used in comparison and difference tables.
3. Data Storage:
   The application likely uses a database to store car data.
   The database schema should include tables for cars, car attributes, and potentially other relevant information.
4. Interactions:
   API Client: Sends requests to the REST endpoints exposed by CarComparisonApi.
   CarComparisonApi: Receives requests, validates them, and calls CarComparisonService to perform the requested operation.
   CarComparisonService: Retrieves car data from the database, performs comparison logic, and returns the results to CarComparisonApi.
   CarComparisonApi: Returns the results to the API client as a JSON response.
